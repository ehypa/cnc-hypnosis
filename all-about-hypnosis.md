# What is hypnosis
No one really knows for sure, although we do know that it is in fact a very concrete brain state (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw220)
Some models of hypnosis include
- The neodissociation model: hypnosis as a dissociated state
- Hypnosis as a psychological phenomenon
- Hypnosis as a passive or permissive state
- Hypnosis as an altered state of consciousness (ASC)
- Hypnosis as a special interactional outcome
- Hypnosis as a sociocognitive phenomenon
- T. X. Barber's “Hypnosis”
- Hypnosis and sociale role playing, role congruence
- Hypnosis as reality testing 
(Trancework: An Introduction to the Practice of Clinical Hypnosis)

## What makes a great subject (how to trance better)
Generally, in order to have the ideal conditions for hypnosis, it is important that
the subject is in a safe space (emotionally and physically), where they can focus
uninterrupted, and that their general mental well being is nominal.

Some good tips include:
- Establishing trust and limits
- Paying attention to hypnotists
- Trying to be flexible and not get hung up
- Trying not to rush anything
- Letting your expectations go a little (if you expect too much covert hypnosis gets harder)
- Not feeling any guilt or shame over lack of trance
- Realizing that you might not know when you are in trance

It's usually also a great idea to have thought about practical things, such as 
being well fed and hydrated, or perhaps having some water nearby so as to not
disturb a good session unnecessarily if one should arise suddenly.
